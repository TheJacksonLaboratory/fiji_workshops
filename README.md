A set of slides and training material written in HTML/CSS with the [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) framework. 
This is an updated, Fiji-only, fork of tutorial materials by [Erick Martins Ratamero](https://github.com/erickmartins/training), those in turns were heavily inspired by the original slides from [Dave Mason](http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~dnmason), from the University of Liverpool [Centre for Cell Imaging](http://cci.liv.ac.uk).
