Welcome! This is the landing page for a repository of workshop materials
for Fiji workshops run at JAX in the 2nd half of 2024.  
Two workshops are planned, an introduction one and a follow-up one that
will get into macros and scripting. You can find descriptions and links
to the materials below.

# Introduction to Fiji Workshop
Fiji is distribution of ImageJ, which has over 25 years of broad usage in 
scientific image analysis. This two-session introductory workshop to Fiji 
will start with introducing the basic concepts of image analysis (e.g. 
pixels, bit-depth) and then it will cover key concepts such as the GUI 
layout, scale bars, measurements, and stacks. The second session will be 
focused on more advanced analysis concepts, including segmentation, 
colocalization, and tracking. Note: this workshop will not delve deeply 
into macros and scripting, this will be the focus of a follow-up workshop.
## [Introduction to Fiji Workshop Materials](./IntroFiji.html)
The above link is to a set of slides and training materials written in HTML/CSS with 
the [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) framework. 
This is an updated, Fiji-only, fork of tutorial materials by
[Erick Martins Ratamero](https://github.com/erickmartins/training), those
in turns were heavily inspired by the original slides from
[Dave Mason](https://mas.to/@dn_mason), then at the University of 
Liverpool [Centre for Cell Imaging](http://cci.liv.ac.uk).

# Intermediate Fiji Workshop
Fiji is distribution of ImageJ, which has over 25 years of broad usage in 
scientific image analysis. This two-session introductory workshop to Fiji 
will focus on macros and scripting.
## Workshop materials
In preparation. Stay tuned.
